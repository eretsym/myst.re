          hi, my nickname is myst√®re, i am a 23 years old french guy. interested
          in low-level programming, hacking, retro-engineering and computer
          science as a whole since childhood, i work on multiple projects
          related to these fields in favor of a career following this
          interesting journey. i am a day dreamer with a very analytic view on
          life, which grants me with creativity and logic combo that i really
          like.

          thus i started making music as a hobby in 2017 and publicly released
          my first track Quantum Drive under the nickname Hyperwav in 2019,
          following my friends feedback. as a feeling driven kind of person i
          like to express emotion into sound. recently i started another music
          project named cn96 fucusing on lo-fi house beats.
